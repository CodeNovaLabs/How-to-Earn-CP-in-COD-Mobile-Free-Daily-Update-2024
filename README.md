## Methods to Earn Free CP in COD Mobile (2024 Update)

### 1. **Participate in In-Game Events**

COD Mobile regularly hosts special in-game events where players can earn rewards, including CP, just by completing certain challenges or objectives. These events are often themed around holidays, game updates, or seasonal changes. For example, during major updates, COD Mobile may offer limited-time events where players can earn CP for completing specific missions.

#### How to Participate:
- Open the game and go to the **Events** tab.
- Look for events offering CP as a reward.
- Complete the required challenges or tasks.

By staying active and participating in these events, you can easily accumulate CP without having to spend any money.

### 2. **Complete Daily and Weekly Missions**

Another straightforward method of earning free CP in COD Mobile is by completing **daily** and **weekly missions**. These missions are designed to keep players engaged and reward them with various prizes, including CP.

#### Steps to Complete Missions:
- Check the **Mission** tab every day and week.
- Complete simple tasks like earning kills, winning matches, or performing specific actions.
- As you accumulate progress, you will unlock CP as one of the rewards.

Some of these missions are relatively easy to complete, and they offer a good amount of CP. So, if you're consistent in playing, you can gradually build up a significant amount of CP without spending any real money.

### 3. **Rank Up in Battle Pass**

The **Battle Pass** system in COD Mobile is another excellent way to earn free CP. While the premium Battle Pass requires players to spend money, the **free Battle Pass** still offers a chance to earn CP through its tiers.

#### How to Unlock Free CP in Battle Pass:
- Play the game regularly to earn **Battle Pass XP**.
- Rank up through the tiers of the free Battle Pass.
- Some tiers will unlock **CP** as part of the rewards.

Even though the free Battle Pass does not offer as many rewards as the premium version, it still gives players the chance to earn CP as they progress through different levels.

### 4. **Take Advantage of Special Offers and Giveaways**

COD Mobile often runs special promotions and giveaways, especially during major updates or community celebrations. These offers can include free CP, in-game currency, or even exclusive items. Keep an eye on official COD Mobile social media accounts, community channels, and in-game announcements to ensure you donâ€™t miss out on these free rewards.

#### How to Stay Updated on Offers:
- Follow **COD Mobile** on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
- Subscribe to **COD Mobile newsletters** or official communications.
- Check the **store** for time-limited offers, discounts, and giveaways.

By staying informed, you can take advantage of these limited-time offers to claim free CP and other exclusive rewards.

### 5. **Referral Programs and Invite Friends**

COD Mobile sometimes introduces referral programs that reward players for inviting friends to join the game. These programs often offer free CP as a reward for both the inviter and the invitee once specific milestones are achieved.

#### Steps to Use Referral Programs:
- Look out for **Referral Program** announcements in the game.
- Share your referral link with friends.
- Once your friends join the game and meet specific objectives, both you and your friends will earn CP.

This is a great way to earn free CP while sharing the fun with your friends. Plus, youâ€™ll get a boost in your in-game progress when they start playing.

### 6. **Watch Ads for Rewards**

COD Mobile has integrated ads into its game mechanics, offering players the option to watch ads in exchange for rewards, including CP. While it may seem like a small reward, watching ads is a no-cost way to earn extra CP over time.

#### How to Earn CP by Watching Ads:
- Look for ad prompts in the game, often located in the **Store** or **Rewards** sections.
- Watch the ads to claim small amounts of CP.
- Repeat the process as the game offers new ads.

Although this method wonâ€™t provide large amounts of CP, itâ€™s a quick and easy way to earn small rewards consistently.

### 7. **Participate in Tournaments and Competitive Play**

COD Mobile also features **competitive events**, tournaments, and seasonal leagues where players can earn CP based on their performance. These events can range from casual competitions to highly competitive tournaments, offering great rewards for top players.

#### How to Participate in Competitive Events:
- Check the **Tournament** tab in the game for upcoming events.
- Register for the event and play your best.
- Top performers often earn CP and other exclusive prizes.

These competitive events are an excellent way to not only improve your skills but also earn CP and rise in the ranks of the COD Mobile community.
